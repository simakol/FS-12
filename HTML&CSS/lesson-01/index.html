    <h1><i>The Tale of Igor's Campaign</i></h1>
    <hr>

    <p><strong><i>The Tale of Igor's Campaign</i></strong> or <strong><i>The Tale of Ihor's Campaign</i></strong> (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_East_Slavic">Old East Slavic</a>:
        Слово о пълкѹ Игоревѣ, romanized: <i>Slovo o pŭlku Igorevě</i>) is an anonymous epic poem written in the Old
        East
        Slavic language. The title is occasionally translated as The Tale of the Campaign of Igor, The Song of Igor's
        Campaign, The Lay of Igor's Campaign, The Lay of the Host of Igor, and The Lay of the Warfare Waged by Igor.
        <br>
        <br>
        The poem gives an account of a failed raid of Igor Svyatoslavich (d. 1202) against the Polovtsians of the Don
        River region. While some have disputed the authenticity of the poem, the current scholarly consensus is that the
        poem is authentic and dates to the Middle Ages (late 12th century).
        <br>
        <br>
        The Tale of Igor's Campaign was adapted by Alexander Borodin as an opera and became one of the great classics of
        Russian theatre. Entitled Prince Igor, it was first performed in 1890.</p>

    <p>The story describes a failed raid made in year 1185 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knyaz" target="_blank">Kniaz</a>
        Igor Svyatoslavich, Prince of Novgorod-Seversk, on
        the Polovtsians living along the lower Don. Other Rus' historical figures are mentioned, including skald Boyan
        (The Bard), the princes Vseslav of Polotsk, Yaroslav Osmomysl of Halych, and Vsevolod the Big Nest of Suzdal.
        The author appeals to the warring Rus' princes and pleads for unity in the face of the constant threat from the
        Turkic East. Igor's campaign is recorded in the Kievan Chronicle (c. 1200).
        <br>
        <br>
        The descriptions show coexistence between Christianity and ancient Slavic religion. Igor's wife Yaroslavna
        invokes natural forces from the walls of Putyvl. Christian motifs are presented along with depersonalised pagan
        gods among the artistic images. The main themes of the story are patriotism, the power and role of nature (at
        the time of the story, 12th century) and homeland. The main idea is the unity of people.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Tale has been compared to other national epics, including The Song of Roland and The Song of the
        Nibelungs.[4] The book however differs from contemporary Western epics on account of its numerous and vivid
        descriptions of nature and the portrayal of the role which nature plays in human lives.
